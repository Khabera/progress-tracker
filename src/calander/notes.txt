An Overarching Date Tracking Mechanism, meaning an array with day, month, year,
which could each be objects, constructed in a certain method.
Each year is constructed so that there they contain an array of months,
and each month is constructed so that is has an array of days, which Im not sure where I would put

and they need to be stored, and reconstructed every time I come back to the page

Object
year:
  number: x
  months: [name: january
            dates: [1-31]]
            day: date: x
                 focus: x
                 note: x
                 goal time: x
                 specific tasks: x, x (which should be tied to objects either in the book or project? and possibily a selection)
                 time: x (linked to home screen)

add an ez zoom along the side, which switches from year/month/30 days/10days/5days/1day                 
and there
