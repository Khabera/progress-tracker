<h1><strong>Learning Opportunity</strong></h1>
<p>While much of this project is an opportunity to practice things I already know, and continue to learn some of the small things I need here and there, a large goal of this project is was to write code that well organized, and adheres to SOLID principles.

Additionally, because I was continually dissapointed with the UI of the webapps I had been building, I downloaded Adobe XD, and layed out the app in a way I found satisfactory, themed close to UX/UI project I enjoyed, <a href=https://www.behance.net/gallery/126901637/HAVEN-UXUI-Case-Study>HAVEN by Muskan Attri</a></p>
