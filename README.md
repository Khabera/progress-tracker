<h1><strong>Project Goal</strong></h1>
<p>The Odin Project suggests building a todo-list towards the end of the first Javascript section. Because I was already tracking some my self-taught [web development] learning with an excel sheet, this project seemed to be a good opportunity to build a web app expand that and have the interface to track everything I would really like to, including "to-do" style functionality.</p>
<h1><strong>Learning Opportunity</strong></h1>
<p>While much of this project is an opportunity to practice things I already know, and continue to learn some of the small things I need here and there, a large goal of this project is to write the code in well-organized way. Following the classic "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Objects" I wanted to add enough functionality complexity into the web-app (perhaps more than I really wanted for my use,) in order for it to be apparent if I was organizing my code well or not.</p>
